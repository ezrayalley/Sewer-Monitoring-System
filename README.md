# 🚀 Sewer Monitoring System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Sewer Monitoring System** is an IoT and Machine Learning-based solution designed to enhance urban sewer management. The system monitors critical sewer parameters such as water levels, toxic gas concentration, temperature, and manhole lid displacement to prevent hazardous situations. By leveraging real-time data collection, predictive analytics, and automated alerts, this project aims to improve public safety, reduce maintenance costs, and contribute to smart city infrastructure.
